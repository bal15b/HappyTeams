From what I have seen both from previous projects I have worked with my team mates and the responses that they put on the Drucker Test I am primarily going to be coding. This means I will probably not be the only one programming but instead the one who does the bulk of it. I will have to work with my team specifically on planning what we need to do next and designing what it should do.
